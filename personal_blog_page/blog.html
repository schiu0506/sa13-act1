                    by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and

                    his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following 
                    two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis 
                    "Red" Redding, and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by 
                    the prison warden Samuel Norton. William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil 
                    Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.</p>
